# R Simulation Project

This repository contains R scripts for simulating and visualizing the results of three different problems. Each problem involves simulating a scenario and plotting the resulting data for analysis.

## Problems

### 1. Mountain Climbing Flag Placement Simulation

The first problem involves simulating the placement of flags while climbing a mountain under various conditions. The simulation takes into account factors such as altitude, wind speed, and terrain steepness. Histograms are generated to visualize the distribution of flag placements.

### 2. Online Video Streaming Simulation

The second problem focuses on simulating online video streaming with random starting points and varying bandwidth speeds. The simulation helps analyze the impact of these factors on the user experience. Visualizations are created to illustrate the streaming behavior.

### 3. Potato Cooking Simulation

The third problem involves simulating the cooking process of potatoes in a pan. The simulation determines the optimal time to shake the pan for achieving perfectly cooked potatoes. Graphs are generated to show the cooking progression and the impact of shaking frequency.
